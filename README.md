# Java-Projects

## It's just a Simple Collection of my Java Projects

### They are 5 Java based Projects that I have developed using Swings and some are simple Encryption Algorithms:
- [CaesarCipher](#caesar-cipher)
- [Currency Converter](#currency-converter)
- [DheerCipher](#dheercipher)
- [Jumbler](#jumbler)
- [Onlinetest](#online-test)

### Caesar Cipher
The Most popular and simple encryption systems of all. Implementation of Caesar Cipher could be of many ways but I have modified it and made it more simple using Hash-Indexes using which the Encryption and Decryption ie. shift of letters could be done much more quickly.

### Currency Converter
Using Java Swings we can at the time see INR conversion value to 5 different and Popular Currency values.

### DheerCipher
My own Encryption and Decryption Method that uses special value and function that provides a level of Stronger Encrpyted values that doesn't burdens the CPU and gives Encrpyted values faster than excepted in Encrypted Fucntions.

### Jumbler
Those who love Permutations and Combinations!! Providing any value into the system would generate all possible combinations that could be generated with that value

### Online Test
Java Swings Application that takes test and generates Result on the Go!!

## Important Note
Also the user would include the Git link used and Contributor's name in their work.
